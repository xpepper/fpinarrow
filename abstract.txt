Functional programming in Kotlin: exploring Arrow

Functional programming is gaining popularity and partly because of this people have been switching to Kotlin.
Although it fits the paradigm better than Java, there is still quite a bit missing to unleash the full power of FP.

In this talk we will go through what problems Arrow can solve for you and how it can help you with your everyday programming.
