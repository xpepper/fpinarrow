Functional programming in Kotlin: exploring Arrow

Functional programming is gaining popularity and partly because of this people have been switching to Kotlin.
Although it fits the paradigm better than Java, there is still quite a bit missing to unleash the full power of FP.
Arrow is here to fill in the missing bits with things like new datatypes, e.g. Try, Either, and Optics. Arrow is the most popular functional programming library for Kotlin.
In this talk we will go through what problems Arrow can solve for you and how it can help you with your everyday programming.

I am very passionate about this subject, and I also love teaching/sharing knowledge. So combining my teaching experience with energy from passion (and some programmer humor) I can give a well structured introduction to the Arrow framework that should be suited for most people (even if there is no previous experience with kotlin or functional programming)
